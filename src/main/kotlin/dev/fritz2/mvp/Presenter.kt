 * A presenter should contain the business logic for a specific use case. It should not contain any view related code
 * like (web) components or DOM elements. Instead, it should focus on the actual use case, work on the model, listen to
 * events and update its view.
 *
 * Presenters are singletons which are created lazily and which are then reused. They're bound to a specific string
 * token (aka place). They need to be registered using a token, and a function to create the presenter.
 * Use the presenter's companion object to register presenters:
 *
 * ```
 * class ApplePresenter : Presenter<AppleView> {
 *     override val view = AppleView()
 * }
 *
 * class AppleView : View {
 *     override val elements = listOf(
 *         render {
 *             p { +"üçé" }
 *         })
 * }
 *
 * Presenter.register("apple", ::ApplePresenter)
 * ```
 *
 * @param V the type of the presenter's view
